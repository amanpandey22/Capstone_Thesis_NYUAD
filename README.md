# Capstone_Thesis_NYUAD
This is my final year project at New York University Abu Dhabi. 

In this project, we look at the relationship between the sentiment expressed on Twitter regarding the stock market and the change in the stock price of S\&P 500 during the COVID pandemic (January- August 2020). Using Granger Causality and Vector Auto Regression (VAR), we study the correlation between the daily sentiment with daily change in the stock price of the S\&P 500. We find that out of six different sentiments (Compound, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear) as measured by text analysis tools (VAR and text2emotion), only two sentiments, Angry and Surprise, are significant in granger causing the changes in stock price movement of S\&P 500 during the pandemic. By comparing our results with similar research on the financial crisis, we also analyze how the COVID pandemic was different from other economic crises and how people's sentiment about the stock market during the pandemic was different and short-lived.
